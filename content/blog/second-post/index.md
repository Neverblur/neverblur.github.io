The 33-year-old engineer, who works for a technology company in Tokyo, had only two days of holiday last year. It’s not because he couldn’t take more: he is in fact entitled to 20 days annual leave.

Instead, like many Japanese workers, taking time off work beyond the absolute minimum is simply not an option. “It’s difficult because the atmosphere in the workplace wouldn't allow it,” says Hideyuki, who has two children, aged six and four, and is reluctant to give his full name due to potential repercussions at work.

“I don’t want my manager to be saying anything bad about me because I took the day off. It is easier to just work rather than them saying bad things about me or being told off.”

Japan is facing something of an epidemic in unused annual holiday leave among its famously conscientious workforce – with workers taking only 52.4% of the paid leave to which they were entitled in 2018, according to the most recent government figures.

The main reason is guilt – a reflection of the pressures and expectations that weigh heavily on a workaholic society. The average worker still has dozens of untaken vacation days every year. Why has change been so slow?

‘I cannot be the only person taking time off work’

It’s perhaps unsurprising that the words “Japan” and “holiday” rarely feature in the same sentence. The nation has long been famed for an intense work culture defined by arduously long hours – it’s normal for workers to take the last train home every night.

Japan is also the birthplace of karoshi – “death from overwork” – a word invented in the 1970s to describe deaths caused by work-related stresses and pressures. Unfortunately, it’s still a regular fixture in Japan’s lexicon today.
